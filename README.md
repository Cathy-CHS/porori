You can reproduce the results of the paper by simply running all cells in the `main_for_submit.ipynb`


Since CPU of the colab is not that fast, the KG construction time can be too long in colab. So we uploaded 

the precomputed KGs in the `precomputed_results/` folder. You can use them to reproduce the results of the paper.

To use this precomputed results, try the 'Graph analysis on Precomputed KGs' section in the main_for_submit.ipynb.
